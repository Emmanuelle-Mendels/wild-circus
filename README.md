Subject 1: Wild Circus

Some time ago, in order to become a Wilder, we asked you to create a simple static web page, the Wild Circus. At that time, you only knew some HTML, CSS and maybe a little bit of Javascript.


It feels like a long time ago, doesn't it? It was only a few months ago!

Look how far you've come! You've since learned to develop great websites with multiple dynamic features.

Working on projects in a team is very important for your future professional career, however, sometimes, working alone allows you to better reflect on your progress. That's why we are giving you the opportunity to work on a new application on your own. And you have up to 2 days to complete it.

So, let's build a new Wild Circus experience with all these new skills that you‚Äôve acquired!

You are free to design this experience as you wish, and here are some ideas to inspire you. Please note that these are only examples, not required features. So let your imagination run wild!
‚Ä¢an administration panel to add/edit circus acts
‚Ä¢a gallery of your fellow Wilders portrayed as circus artists
‚Ä¢a ticket booking system
‚Ä¢wild circus shows around you geolocation system
‚Ä¢awesome stuff from your imagination, you are your own product owner!

    Be careful though, you're limited in time so be sure to plan accordingly. You must provide something functional by the end of the time limit.
